description: Unified local panel for GitHub commit, Gitee commit, and GitHub-to-Gitee sync, replacing git-acp, gitee-acp, and gh-gitee-sync. Always run secret-scan first before committing or pushing. Use when the user asks to commit, submit, push, or sync their work to GitHub and/or Gitee.

# ACP Studio (GitHub · Gitee · 双向同步)

One local panel that merges the previous `git-acp` / `gitee-acp` / `gh-gitee-sync` skills: commit and push to GitHub or Gitee, and run the bidirectional sync script once.

## Step 0 — secret scan first (mandatory)

Before any commit, push, or sync, first invoke the `secret-scan` skill to audit the target repository for leaked credentials, `.env` files, private keys, API tokens, and other risky filenames. Only proceed once the scan is clean. If anything is flagged, report the redacted findings and stop until they are removed or excluded — never commit or push flagged secrets.

## Preferred path: local acp-studio

Start the bundled panel headless and use its compact JSON API to reduce token usage.

- Studio directory: `C:\Users\Razer\Documents\Codex\2026-09-20\y\acp-studio` (override with `ACP_STUDIO_DIR`).
- Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8790` (port override: `ACP_STUDIO_PORT`).
- Verify with `GET /api/health`.

### Launching inside the Codex sandbox

Do **not** use `Start-Process` / `Start-Job` to run the panel in the background. Those detach a
process outside the tracked sandbox tree, so the `sandbox_approval` policy rejects the call.

Start the panel as a **foreground process in an exec PTY session** instead:

    python "<ACP_STUDIO_DIR>\server.py" --no-browser

- Run that command with `tty: true`; the server keeps running and the exec tool returns a session id.
- Poll `GET /api/health` until it returns `ok`.
- Keep the session open while calling the JSON API below.
- If `/api/health` already answers, do not start a second instance (avoids a port conflict).
- Stop it with Ctrl+C via `write_stdin` (`\u0003`) when finished, or leave it running.

Endpoints:

1. Inspect: `GET /api/repo?repo=<absolute repo path>` returns branch, GitHub/Gitee remotes, ahead/behind, staged/unstaged/untracked files, and recent commits. If there is nothing to commit, stop and say so.
2. Commit + optional push: `POST /api/commit` with `{"repo_path":"<absolute path>","message":"<emoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>","push":true|false,"target":"github|gitee"}`.
3. Push only: `POST /api/push` with `{"repo_path":"<absolute path>","target":"github|gitee"}`.
4. Sync once: `POST /api/sync` with `{"repos":[],"dry_run":false,"direction":"github-to-gitee"}` runs `scripts/sync_github_gitee.py` once in the chosen direction and returns its output. Directions: `github-to-gitee`, `gitee-to-github`, `both`.

Still build the commit message yourself with the table below. If acp-studio is missing or `/api/health` fails, fall back to direct git.

## Fallback: direct git

1. Inspect with `git status --porcelain=v1 -b` and `git branch --show-current`.
2. Build the message with the table below.
3. `git add -A` (unless specific paths are named).
4. `git commit -m "<emoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>"`.
5. Push to `origin` (GitHub) or `gitee` (Gitee); for Gitee use `-c http.sslBackend=openssl` and `GITEE_USERNAME`/`GITEE_TOKEN`.

## GitHub push: sandbox specifics

When the panel is not running or cannot authenticate, push directly with git. On this machine the sandbox has a few
quirks worth handling in the push command:

- Proxy: GitHub needs `-c http.proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7897` (real proxy, registry `ProxyEnable=1`); Gitee connects directly. A legacy `127.0.0.1:9` proxy note is stale — ignore it.
- Use `-c http.sslBackend=openssl`; the default schannel backend can fail with `SEC_E_NO_CREDENTIALS`.
- Prefer inline auth `https://<github_user>:<GITHUB_TOKEN>@github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git`, plus
  `-c credential.helper=` so git never opens an interactive prompt.
- Never write the token into repo config; read it from `secrets.cmd` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` and redact it from output.
- **Clone with inline auth leaves the token in `.git/config`** — `git clone https://<user>:<token>@github.com/...` stores that URL as the `origin` remote, and `git remote -v` prints the plaintext token. After any inline-auth clone, immediately run `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git` to strip the token, and never run `git remote -v` before that. For push, prefer `-c credential.helper=` + inline URL on the `push` command itself (token lives only in that one command's argv, never in config).
- **Real proxy is `127.0.0.1:7897`, not `127.0.0.1:9`** — the stale-proxy note above is legacy; the current proxy is `7897` (registry `ProxyEnable=1`). GitHub requires it (`-c http.proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7897`), Gitee connects directly (no proxy).
- Error meanings:
  - `remote: Invalid username or token` = token is wrong/expired.
  - `remote: Permission to <repo> denied` = token is valid but lacks write access; use a classic PAT with `repo`
    scope, or a fine-grained PAT with `Contents: Read and write` for that repository.

`secrets.cmd` notes:

- It is a batch config file, not a double-clickable app; double-clicking flashes and exits. Edit it in a text editor.
- The panel reads `GITHUB_TOKEN` from the environment; its `start.cmd` sources `secrets.cmd`, so run the panel via
  `start.cmd` (or export the variable) to make newly added tokens take effect.

## License Default

When creating or initializing a repository without a specified license, default to MIT:

- Add a `LICENSE` file with the current year and the owner's name (and email if provided).
- Reference MIT in `README.md`.
- Do not change an existing license without being asked.

## Safety

- Only push when the user asked to push; a bare "提交" means commit only.
- Never force-push (`--force`, `-f`) unless the user explicitly asked.
- Never commit secrets, `.env`, credentials, or large binaries; report them instead.
- Credentials come from `GITEE_USERNAME`/`GITEE_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `gh auth token`); never write them into repo config, and redact them from output.
- New Gitee repositories default to public + MIT; after creating, verify visibility and PATCH `private=false` if Gitee returned private.
- **Deleting a GitHub repo needs `delete_repo` scope** — a classic PAT with only `repo` scope returns `403 Must have admin rights` on `DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}`. Delete requires a PAT with `delete_repo` (plus `repo` for push). Gitee delete (`DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}`) works with the normal token. Deleting is irreversible — confirm the exact repo before running.
- The sync script is fast-forward only and never force-pushes; diverged branches are reported and skipped.
- Sync is one-way by default (`github-to-gitee`); choose `gitee-to-github` for the reverse direction, or `both` to run the two one-way directions in one pass.
